0.12 2009-07-22
    - Now requires version 1.33 of WWW::Mechanize::Cached as this release
      fixes the CODE items error
    - Added bing.com to engines
    - Added fastbrowsersearch.com to engines

    - Added answers.yahoo.com to engines

0.11 2009-07-10
    - Wrapped $mech->get in an eval in order to get by the following cryptic
      error message:
      Can't store CODE items at ../../lib/Storable.pm
      (autosplit into ../../lib/auto/Storable/_freeze.al) line 290,
      at /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.7/WWW/Mechanize/Cached.pm line 118
      I believe this error occurs when WWW::Mechanize::Cached deals with
      pages that return 403 response codes
    - have disabled AOL tests in t/005_parse_more.t because AOL is currently
      blocking me and returning 403 responses.  URI::ParseSearchString doesn't
      do any mechanized searchs, so it cannot deal with AOL's encoded URLs

0.10 2008-11-20
    - Added search.incredimail.com to engines
    - Added search.rogers.com to engines
    - Added search.rr.com to engines
    - Added searchservice.myspace.com to engines
    - moved dogpile tests to extended url tests
    - Added yandex.ru to engines
    - Added youtube.com to engines

0.09 2008-10-30
    - Moved googlesyndication.com tests as they were causing
      failing test reports.  Some of these tests are tricky
      as we can't reliably predict that these URLs will
      always be available. They are now in t/006_extended.t
      and must be explicitly enabled.

0.08 2008-10-29
    - Fixed license in Makefile as it never actually made it into 0.07
    - Caching is now disabled by default
    - Fixed bug with escaped single quotes in search strings
    - Added set_cached() and get_cached() methods
    - Updated get_mech() to return either a WWW::Mechanize or
      WWW::Mechanize::Cached object, depending on the return value of
      get_cached()

0.07 2008-10-09
    - Added license to Makefile to improve Kwalitee

0.06 2008-10-09
    - Tweaked aol regex so that it doesn't flag urls in which
      aol is a referring url
    - Added googlesyndication as its own engine
    - Tweaked comcast params
    - Added ebay, nextag, dogpile, cuil.com
    - Fixed bug where parsing would die if no title found in mech lookup
    - Fixed problem with escaped, quoted strings under mod_perl
    - Added very basic example script to examples folder

      results of se_term() or parse_search_string()

0.03 2007-07-27
    - Added Test::Pod::Coverage, Test::Pod and File::Spec to prerequisites
